  "address-choice": {
    "question": "Why can't I choose the address?",
    "answer": "Currently it uses the token bridge always sends tokens to the same address on the other blockchain network, and so the sender and the receiver will always have the same address.\nYou will have the option to send to another address in the next version."

    "question": "I sent RSK tokens to an Ethereum address",
    "answer": "Note that if you have tokens on the RSK network, such as RIF or RDOC, including **crossed** tokens such as rUSDT or rDAI, you **should not** send them to an Ethereum address in a regular transaction. This **does not** work! Instead, you should use the RSK Token Bridge to cross the tokens from one blockchain to the other."
